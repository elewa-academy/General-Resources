hi there class

this is a midterm of sorts to assess your progress before moving on to collaboration. 
There is no special order in which you need to do these.  When your'e done with one, come look it over with one of us and we'll give you feedback.
You should do these alone, without helping eachother.  but the internet is fair game

A finished solution will be a repository containing:
	specs for your final code
	your final code
	saved samples of your steps along the way to completion
	a nice readme
	a demo of the mvc task
If your folder isn't complete, we'll send you away to finish it.

If you do this well, it can be a good portfolio stuffer.
