/*
What is object oriented programming?
	bundling data with all the functionality needed to mofidy it

What is a bank Account?  a number you can:
	
	add to
	subtract from
	view

we will gradually wrap this functionality in more complicated implementation

some steps look trivial but represent crucial leaps in abstraction
others look fancy but are just changes in syntax
the final example is everything thrown together, figure it out

To get the most out of this material:
	write specs
	run it in your console
	write your own console logs
	search google for complimentary videos and resources
	don't move on until you can explain each line
	always keep in mind the core bank account functionality
