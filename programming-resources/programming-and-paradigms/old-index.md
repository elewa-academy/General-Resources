Hi.  this is a mini-course on programming languages, programming paradigms, and using js.

paradigms are a controvercial topic in the the world of JS.  Here's our layout of the debate starting with explanations of each competing paradigm, a look into how JS works, and finally how we think you should use JS.

tl;dr - js is a nifty mix.  It's probably best to use objects at the small scale and functional at the large scale

1. [Programming languages and paradigms](https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/02-programming-languages.md)
2. [procedural programming](https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/01-procedural-programming.md)
3. [abstractions](https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/programming-and-paradigms/03-abstractions.md)
